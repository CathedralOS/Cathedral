# Owner questions

Only unresolved owner-level Cathedral semantic, compatibility, architecture,
or trust decisions belong here. Settled decisions live in the
[specification](wiki/spec/README.md); implementation work and deliberately
deferred research do not.

Before adding a question:

1. Name the concrete product or implementation requirement that is blocked.
2. Cite the specification owners and machine-readable contracts checked and
   found silent.
3. Separate the owner choice from ordinary engineering or extraction work.
4. State the viable choices, their invariant and compatibility consequences,
   and a recommended answer.

A missing specification page is not by itself an owner question. Neither is an
implementation difficulty. Promote a gap only when a real customer forces a
choice that cannot safely be inferred from an accepted contract.

Questions are a mutable decision queue, not stable contract identities. Code,
tests, and settled documentation must cite the specification clause produced by
the answer rather than an owner-question number. Resolving a question updates
the specification and affected source contracts in the same change, then
removes the question. Git retains the discussion history.

Existing `Key Questions` and `Open Questions` in design chapters are design
inventory. They are not automatically owner questions under this narrower
standard.

## Open questions

None. Known boot-frontier gaps currently require specification extraction or
implementation work, not a new owner-level decision.
