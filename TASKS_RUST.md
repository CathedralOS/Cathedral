# Rust reference OS: tasks and handoff

Updated 2026-10-17 (local date). Implementation baseline: the recursive
user-close change following **`cba1d49`**. The chooser/store architecture from that
commit remains; matrices now aggregate descendant LOSS replies so a whole user
can be closed and reopened. Check Git for later work.

## Start here

F5 boots one desktop to a chooser over the folder of users. **Preserve that as
the default experience.** From the repository root:

```powershell
python tools/boot-harness-rs/run.py --release --window
```

This is exactly what the single [VS Code launch entry](.vscode/launch.json) runs.
The composition is [distribution/profile.json](source-rs/distribution/profile.json).
It uses x86-64 QEMU/TCG and UEFI.

- **NEW** copies the template user beside it. Click a user to run it: it is a
  matrix whose chrome, a second chooser over the user's realm, lists the user's
  Notes and Colors. Click one to launch it, then click the program to focus it.
- Notes keeps up to eight notes of 240 ASCII characters in its realm.
  Type letters/digits/spaces; Enter inserts a newline, Left/Right move the
  cursor, Backspace deletes. F1 saves or reconciles an uncertain save; F2
  reloads confirmed storage; F3 duplicates the saved note as a new note that
  shares its content; F4 switches to the next note. A bar below the text shows
  the notes, with the current one bright.
- Colors changes its color on Enter and keeps it, because its state nests under
  its own program like everything else's.
- **CLOSE** in a chooser asks the running program what it would lose and stops
  it only on an answer of nothing; an unsaved note stays open. Launching while
  the slot is taken answers BUSY. The outer chooser can close a whole user:
  its matrix recursively checks its children, retaining the user when a
  descendant is dirty, busy or unresponsive. Reopening restores its stored state.
  Up/Down/Enter work in a focused chooser.

Interactive state persists in **`build/boot-harness-rs/cathedral-storage.raw`**:
the users you made, their notes and colors. Missing media is created; existing
media is never automatically reformatted. The programs are installed into the
image on first launch and republished as new revisions when their bytes
change; the sidecar `cathedral-storage.raw.programs` records what is installed.
An image from before this layout holds other objects at the numbers the
programs need; the installer refuses to overwrite anything that is not a
program, so delete that file to start clean. `notes-storage.raw` and
`matrix-database-storage.raw` belong to the notes and probe desktop fixtures.
Automated tests use separate disposable images.

## The architecture, in the owner's words

Realms are the attenuated filesystem. Matrices are programs that attenuate,
heavily or not. If the boot matrix is correct, holds every capability, can
launch programs, and the filesystem is database-backed and attenuable, the rest
of the matrix falls out for almost free. The real logic is then that a launched
program gets its own subtree for free: everything nested under the program's
object, because files are folders in this database.

The intended shape, not yet built: boot into the boot matrix, which runs the
user selection and creation software; a user matrix carries an installed
windower or chrome. Today the owner program stands in for the boot matrix and
the chooser stands in for both the user software and the chrome.

## What the store milestones established

The thesis is that cheap file copies make cheap world copies. A root holds
numbered objects arranged as a tree; chunks and manifests are shared within the
root; a copy writes a head, an event and an edge; a subtree copy does that for
every object beneath the source. A matrix grants a child a subtree rather than
a root, stamps that scope on every request it forwards, and the provider
enforces every stamp, so a program sees its realm and nothing beside it.

Programs live in the store. The harness installs the profile's `programs` into
the notes root as objects, trimmed to their loadable bytes, nested as the
profile says, with `folder` entries as empty containers. A matrix runs one with
`RUN_OBJECT`, and now a child runs one with `LAUNCH`: the matrix reads the
object through the requester's own binding, so a program can only run what it
can see, admits the sealed reply as the sibling's code in the slot the owner
opened with a standing `LAUNCH_POLICY` and `LAUNCH_PLACE`, and grants it that
object's subtree. `CLOSE` asks the host to stop the sibling; the host asks the
sibling `LOSS` on its control link first and keeps it on any answer but
nothing. The owner reads what a slot holds with `STORAGE_BINDING` and restores
exactly that after replacing a provider.

A user is a subtree copy of the template user: a matrix executable with the
chrome, Notes and Colors inside it. The desktop furnishes every user matrix the
same way it furnishes the root: the chrome in the first slot over the whole
realm, a standing policy for the second. `desktop_test.py` drives this from F5
and an independent host model verifies the whole layout; the headless storage
fixture runs a program from its realm, launches a sibling and closes it.

The kernel's contribution stays one syscall for code from sealed objects. It
now allows eight reader rights per task and a reader page budget of up to four
times the per-object cap, because a matrix hub pins every image its subtree
shows, holds old and new during replacement, and lends the same budget to each
nested matrix. The kernel still knows no matrix, realm or store.

## Decisions and working expectations

- Cathedral is one monorepo: an independently usable **kernel**, a blessed common
  **platform** outside it, and one replaceable **distribution**. Desktop policy
  belongs to the distribution; capability enforcement belongs to its owning
  kernel/platform mechanism. Contracts live with the boundary owner.
- A matrix is an ordinary program. The instance handed provider links is the
  storage root and the one handed display/input endpoints adapts hardware;
  every other instance only forwards and attenuates. Nothing branches on depth
  or on an argument word, and nothing tunnels through a matrix to use its
  authority: its owner grants, its children request, the provider decides.
- Delegation narrows and never widens. A grant names a scope inside what the
  granting matrix holds; the provider, not the matrices, is what makes the chain
  binding. Hosting is copying: a matrix that hosts programs holds them in its
  own realm, and a child launches only what its own binding can read.
- Use the design's vocabulary. A realm is a subtree held through a binding;
  a world is a matrix's realm in the wiki's sense (the object a matrix owns,
  with its state beneath it), which the Rust OS does not yet implement. Do not
  coin desktop-level names for storage structure.
- Boot launches and storage-less fixtures keep the boot catalogue, because the
  provider itself must come from boot. The matrix's RUN by catalogue image
  serves those compositions; RUN_OBJECT and LAUNCH serve the store.
- Timeouts derive from one number. The matrix contract's `STORAGE_DEADLINE_TICKS`
  bounds a forwarded storage request; nested hops and program reads add a
  margin, the runtime's storage client waits twice it, and the desktop's
  provider watchdog probes past it, so a stalled provider is always reported by
  the matrix's verdict first. These numbers are **ticks**: the current timer
  runs nominally at 100 Hz, so the base deadline is **six seconds**, not 600 ms.
  Keep units explicit and measure actual spans before tuning deadlines.
- Do not add debt to bridge old and new: when a protocol or layer is replaced,
  retire the old one from every composition in the same change and delete it.
  Git history is the only retention wanted.
- Discoverability matters: a named entry shows sequencing/dispatch and leads
  into semantic subfolders. Rust `mod.rs` is plumbing only, beside the substantive
  named entrance. Avoid forwarding-only layers and unrelated folder dumping grounds.
- Keep the OS responsive and understandable. Rendering/input changes need an
  actual QEMU interaction check, not just compilation or a serial success marker.
- Commit and push progress to `main` after each session. Check the working
  tree first and preserve unrelated work. `.codex/` is untracked and
  deliberately untouched.
- Record unresolved owner-level semantics/trust choices in
  [OWNER_QUESTIONS.md](OWNER_QUESTIONS.md). Ordinary implementation bugs and
  refactoring do not require an owner question. Existing design prose contains
  ambitions and unresolved conflicts; do not treat it all as implemented fact.

The [distribution map](source-rs/distribution/README.md) connects executable and
IPC seams. [STATUS.md](source-rs/STATUS.md) has broader mechanism/proof coverage;
[the Rust guide](source-rs/README.md) has ABI/build details.

The kernel is still bounded: twelve task accounts, a small boot-supplied code
catalogue for boot launches, one CPU, static device grants and finite
page/channel budgets. ARM64 is a headless portability proof, not the desktop.
There is no production DMA/IOMMU driver stack, SMP, GPU stack, audio stack or
production DBFS. Do not equate the object store or BLAKE3 layout research with
a finalized filesystem format.

## Composition facts worth knowing

The owner starts display (Launch 0), input (1), root matrix (2) and object
storage (3) from boot. The programs are objects 1 to 6 of the notes root: the
chooser; the folder of users; inside it the template user, a matrix
executable; and inside the template its chrome (the chooser again), Notes and
Colors. Identical bytes share content, so the second chooser costs three small
records. The shell names only the first two by number
([shell.rs](source-rs/distribution/desktop/session/shell/shell.rs)); everything
below is found by listing. Roles come from each executable's entry: a matrix
takes 0, the desktop executable's 2 runs Colors with argument 2, Notes and the
chooser take 2.

Root slot 0 holds the chooser, shown only the users folder; root slot 1 is
opened by a standing policy and holds whatever the chooser launches, a user
matrix. The desktop notices it by polling `STORAGE_BINDING` on that slot and
furnishes it: its chrome in slot 0 over the whole user realm, slot 1 opened
for what the chrome launches. A user made by NEW is a subtree copy of the
template, so user 7 holds chrome 8, Notes 9 and Colors 10; their notes and
color nest under 9 and 10. Apps do not know their global coordinates or
siblings. Storage replacement regrants the chain explicitly from the shell's
numbers and the bindings it observed.

Page budgets are sized for sealed bitmaps held at every matrix level with old
and new present during replacement, plus the largest program a matrix reads
to run it: the root matrix has 128 private and 256 reader pages and lends the
user matrix 72/96; the chooser has 36 private pages (two of its 18-page
bitmaps); Notes 32/4; Colors fits in the same; the provider 128/64; the
display 128 reader pages. The kernel's per-task bound is 128 private and 512
reader pages with eight reader rights; the kernel heap is 256 KiB. Objects
hold at most 256 KiB (64 pages).

A request carries three scope words, so three narrowing grants can stack on one
path; a fourth is refused. Each scoped request costs the provider one ancestry
walk per stamp. Collection before every write scans only metadata and the
key-only chunk index. The older 50/100/150-ms collection/commit/save claims were
not reliable unit conversions and are withdrawn. A fresh traced desktop run is
recorded below. The matrix's base storage deadline is 600 **ticks**, nominally
six seconds; the runtime's 1200-tick wait is nominally twelve. Values were not
retuned in the recursive-close change. All are lab bounds.

`--smoke` uses the default profile's `user_programs`, not its desktop startup
graph; the desktop is tested by `desktop_test.py`.

## Next work, in recommended order

These are proposed follow-ups, not claims that the owner has approved every
future feature. Two owner questions were recorded this session: the boot matrix
as the initial program with what a matrix persists, and object kinds and names
in a realm. Both block the first two items below.

- [ ] **Make the boot matrix the privileged program.** Today the initial
  program is the desktop owner, which admits a root matrix beside itself and
  furnishes matrices with numbers from `shell.rs`. In the owner's framing those
  are one program: boot hands everything to the boot matrix, and the shell is
  a program it hosts from its realm. That needs a policy object a matrix reads
  from its realm, which is the owner question. Do not resolve it by
  implication.
- [ ] **Give objects kinds and names.** The chooser shows numbers and copies
  by position; NEW over a user's realm duplicates the chrome because nothing
  says what an entry is. Login, sessions and a terminal-style shell all wait
  on the same answer.
- [ ] **Keep app lifecycle honest as apps grow.** Startup failure, app crash and
  provider loss while an app holds work still end in assertions in places. A
  program that cannot be read from the realm answers REFUSED in the chooser
  but the desktop asserts on its own launches. Add an adversarial test for each
  failure actually fixed.
- [ ] **Bring storage write latency down.** Collection scans metadata before
  each write and durable commit writes through ATA PIO. Use explicit tick-to-time
  conversion and separate CPU time from elapsed time. Measure with
  `--trace-storage` before changing either; the small sample below is not a
  benchmark or a latency guarantee.
- [ ] **Let the lab desktops run from the store too.** The probe desktop and
  the notes fixtures still lend the boot catalogue, which keeps the admission
  and funding proofs on their original path. When those proofs have store
  equivalents, retire RUN by catalogue image from the matrix.
- [ ] **Choose the next kernel/device milestone deliberately.** A second
  userspace MMIO/IRQ device proof is the candidate. DMA needs a separate buffer
  ownership/isolation design.

An intermittent ATA timeout is recorded in the implementation map and remains
undiagnosed. Retain logs and distinguish a reproduced transport failure from a
guessed cause if it recurs. Once in nine runs, `matrix_database_test.py
--notes-recovery` saw the provider's quiet post-commit gate let the first save
through instead of stalling it; the provider now traces `gate-armed` and
`gate-stall` under `--trace-storage` so the next occurrence shows whether the
gate was armed on the instance that served the save.

## Validation and last evidence

Run Cargo commands **inside `source-rs/`** so its toolchain, aliases and linker
configuration apply:

```powershell
cargo test --locked
cargo test --locked -p cathedral-database-objects --features host
cargo check-userspace
cargo check-uefi
cargo clippy --locked --package cathedral-desktop --target x86_64-unknown-none --features shell -- -D warnings
```

From the repository root, select checks appropriate to the change:

```powershell
python tools/boot-harness-rs/desktop_test.py
python tools/boot-harness-rs/run.py --matrix-desktop-test --release --timeout 180
python tools/boot-harness-rs/run.py --matrix-desktop-test --pressure --release --timeout 240
python tools/boot-harness-rs/run.py --matrix-storage-test --release --timeout 120
python tools/boot-harness-rs/matrix_database_test.py --release
python tools/boot-harness-rs/matrix_database_test.py --release --recovery
python tools/boot-harness-rs/matrix_database_test.py --release --notes
python tools/boot-harness-rs/matrix_database_test.py --release --notes-recovery
python tools/boot-harness-rs/objects_test.py --release
python tools/boot-harness-rs/objects_test.py --retention --release
python tools/boot-harness-rs/resource_budgets_test.py
python tools/source-layout/check.py
python tools/source-layout/check_test.py
python tools/source-layout/format-rust.py --check
```

`desktop_test.py` builds the **same default composition as F5**, installs the
same programs into a disposable image, copies a user from the template with
physical mouse input, launches its programs from the chrome, compares exact
note glyphs, status and note bar, refuses dirty closes, saves, duplicates,
edits the copy, switches back, reloads, repeatedly replaces apps, checks Colors
keeps its color, cold-boots the same disposable disk, and has the host lab
verify the retained records on a copy of the image. `--trace-storage` adds
provider phase timestamps to its serial log. Kernel/arch changes need the
smoke and ARM64 suites documented in their guides:

```powershell
python tools/boot-harness-rs/run.py --smoke --release --timeout 120
python tools/boot-harness-rs/arm64/run.py --release
```

Passed before this handoff, on the chooser commit: the five Cargo commands
above plus clippy of every desktop, notes, matrix and storage feature set the
profiles use, both layout checks and formatting, every harness command listed
above (the notes recovery fixture eight times in a row after the one failure
noted above), the x86 release smoke suite, the ARM64 release proof,
`--matrix-test`, `--admission-test` and `--ipc-test`. Oracles verified the F5 image (six
installed objects, a user copied from the template, two notes sharing one
manifest under its Notes, the color under its Colors, empty second root), the
probe desktop images, the notes images, and both objects proofs.

When handing off again, update the baseline commit, next concrete task, known
failures and verification scope here. Keep durable subsystem detail in its owner
docs, and avoid leaving two conflicting descriptions of the default OS boot.

## Recursive-close handoff evidence

The matrix's [loss survey](source-rs/platform/services/matrix/service/children/loss.rs)
asks both children without blocking their upstream IPC. It replies only after
all requested answers settle and returns only a boolean aggregate, never child
identities or draft contents. Dirty, missing, busy and failed answers keep the
matrix open. Admission/topology commands refuse while a survey is active.
LOSS remains an advisory observation of cooperative children, not a distributed
freeze that prevents later edits. General crash recovery and persisted matrix
configuration remain separate work.

The headless `--matrix-test --release` now checks dirty descendants, a deliberately
delayed clean reply followed by dirty replies, subtree survival after refusal,
exhaustion and restoration of the eight-unanswered-probe allowance without
closing the live child's endpoint, and clean subtree close/recreation while an
outside sibling survives. The actual
F5 test checks the outer CLOSE against a dirty note, repeats whole-user close and
reopen with clean Notes still running, closes a user containing only chrome, and
verifies persistent Notes/Colors plus the cold-boot host oracle.

Fresh traced F5 evidence: `build/boot-harness-rs/desktop/20261017T231701527969Z/`.
The first boot had four measured publication spans and two note saves:

| Span | Count | Min / median / max ticks | Nominal milliseconds (10 ms/tick) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collection | 4 | 14 / 57 / 73 | 140 / 570 / 730 |
| Commit | 4 | 7 / 21 / 122 | 70 / 210 / 1220 |
| Whole note save | 2 | 80 / 129 / 178 | 800 / 1290 / 1780 |

These spans include normal traced publication work, not injected stalls. They
come from one small TCG run on a host also doing validation work, and do not
establish a stable performance distribution. The deadline-unit correction
changes documentation and the constant's name, not the timeout values.

Validation for this recursive-close change: `cargo test --locked`,
`cargo check-userspace`, shell/matrix target clippy, layout checks, formatting,
`--matrix-test --release` (including exhausted-probe recovery),
`--matrix-storage-test --release`, `matrix_database_test.py --release
--notes-recovery`, and the F5 desktop test with and without storage tracing passed.
The final ordinary desktop run is
`build/boot-harness-rs/desktop/20261017T232223657195Z/`; its independent oracle
verified all 189 retained records after cold boot. Notes recovery evidence is
`build/boot-harness-rs/matrix-database/20261017T232129731671Z/` (16 records).
The earlier intermittent gate miss did not occur in this run; it remains open.
No kernel code or timeout value changed, and no new smoke/ARM64 run is claimed.
