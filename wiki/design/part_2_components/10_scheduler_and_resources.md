# Chapter 10: Scheduler & Resource Governance

> Every finite resource is authority. This chapter owns CPU, memory, IO, energy and the rest as *budgeted capabilities*, declared by intent and enforced by the OS.

## The Legacy Contract

A traditional scheduler governs one thing well — CPU time — and the rest badly or not at all. Memory is handed out until the OOM killer fires a blunt, surprising shot. IO, network, GPU, wakeups, battery, thermal headroom, and storage-write endurance are governed by a scatter of unrelated mechanisms: `nice`, cgroups, `ionice`, QoS classes, wake locks, throttling daemons. None of it is unified, and almost none of it is *authority*: a process that can run can, by default, also allocate memory, write the disk, wake the device, and burn the battery. Resource abuse is ambient power that nobody had to grant.

## What Cathedral Wants

Two moves. First, components **declare their resource behavior as intent**, in a vocabulary the OS understands:

```omega
data ResourceIntent {
    class:    WorkloadClass;   // latency_sensitive | interactive_ui |
                               // realtime_audio | background_sync |
                               // batch_compute | power_saving
    deadline: Option<Duration>;
    priority: LatencyPriority;
}
```

Second, the OS **enforces budgets**, and crucially: *resource rights are capabilities too.* You cannot write storage without a storage-write budget; you cannot run in the background without a budget that the power and network policy admit; you cannot allocate beyond your memory envelope.

```omega
Capability<Cpu::Budget(share, deadline_class)>
Capability<Memory::Budget(working_set_max)>
Capability<Storage::WriteBudget(bytes_per_window)>
Capability<Background::Run(power_policy)>
Capability<Gpu::Budget(compute_share)>
```

This folds resource governance into the one authority model ([[03_capability_model]]): the scheduler is not a separate subsystem with its own ad-hoc rules, it is the *enforcement arm* of resource capabilities.

## Concerns & Design Space

- **Capability-gated resource access.** A held budget is required to *touch* a resource, not just to be prioritized within it. Absence of budget = absence of the effect, audited like any capability.
- **Per-component budgets & accounting.** Every instance ([[09_component_model]]) is a billable entity; the OS can always answer "what is this spending."
- **Deadline & realtime-ish scheduling.** `realtime_audio` and `interactive_ui` need bounded latency without true hard-RT guarantees most apps can't honor.
- **Priority inversion.** A high-priority component blocked on a low-priority one holding a resource — inheritance/donation must be modeled, not accidental.
- **Backpressure propagation.** When a downstream service is budget-saturated, pressure must flow upstream as a typed signal, not a silent stall ([[13_error_model_and_recovery]], [[15_ipc_and_service_invocation]]).
- **Memory pressure & OOM policy.** Replace the OOM killer with a negotiated, policy-driven reclaim: components declare shrinkable caches, the OS asks before it takes.
- **Energy & thermal accounting.** Per-component energy attribution and thermal budget as first-class, surfaced to the user ([[14_power_management]], [[33_observability_and_introspection]]).
- **Fairness across tenants.** Budgets must compose hierarchically so one tenant cannot starve another ([[09_component_model]] tenant axis).
- **Abuse prevention.** A component cannot escalate its own budget; only a broker can mint or widen one ([[04_capability_lifecycle]]).

## Key Questions

- What is the canonical resource vocabulary, and is it open (drivers add new resource kinds) or fixed?
- Is a budget a hard ceiling, a weighted share, a reservation, or all three depending on resource kind?
- How does declared intent reconcile with measured behavior — does the OS demote a component that lies about being `power_saving`?
- Where do deadlines come from, and who is trusted to assert `realtime_audio`?

## Omega Leverage

- Resource rights as **capabilities (values + domains)** — `Storage::Writable` with a budget domain — reuse the whole authority machinery ([../../../../Omega/wiki/language_guide/chapter_18_capabilities_effects_boundaries.md](../../../../Omega/wiki/language_guide/chapter_18_capabilities_effects_boundaries.md)).
- **`effects`** already name the resource-touching boundaries (`filesystem_io`, `device_io`, `network_io`); a budget capability is the runtime gate on each.
- A component's lifecycle **`state` graph** exposes natural scheduling points — the scheduler can see *which state* an instance is in, not just that it's runnable.
- Omega does **not** model resource *quantities* or deadlines as proof obligations; budget arithmetic, accounting, and enforcement are Cathedral runtime — a candidate for bounded-value contracts to grow into.

## Open Questions

- Can budgets be expressed tightly enough to *prove* a realtime component meets its deadline, or is that always runtime best-effort?
- How are budgets reclaimed on crash or revocation without a window where a resource leaks?
- Is global energy/thermal a true shared budget all components draw from, and how is that arbitrated fairly under contention?
